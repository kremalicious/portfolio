    Since 2017 I'm leading the UI design & development of Ocean Protocol, iterating on a components-based UI design system spanning all of Ocean Protocol's web properties. Additionally, I conceptualize, execute and iterate on the creative and visual direction of the Ocean Protocol brand.

    Most web interfaces are single-page JavaScript applications built with React, pulling their data from JSON files and various micro services. All design & development is embedded in a continuous deployment process via GitHub & Travis.

    Initial website in collaboration with [Balance](https://balance.io/). Key visuals in collaboration with [Wojciech Hupert](https://twitter.com/wojciechhupert).

    Besides designing and implementing new features, I maintained the front-end of the ChartMogul application and implemented the UI design system by refactoring most of its front-end codebase.

    From 2012–2015 I worked at ezeep, where I helped creating an unprecedented, market-leading & award-winning user experience based on the principles of emotional design way ahead of all competitors. This included conceptualizing executing, and iterating on the creative & visual direction of the ezeep brand.

    I was leading the UI design & development of all ezeep touch points and - as a product designer - defined the ezeep product based on user and market research in an iterative process. On top of that, I designed and helped building all app experiences of ezeep on Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.

    ezeep was acquired by [Cortado AG](https://www.cortado.com) in 2015 and became part of their [ThinPrint Cloud Services](https://www.thinprintcloud.com) suite of products.

    In 2008 I used the camera obscura as it was used by Nicéphore Niépce in 1826 to create an Aperture and iPhoto replacement icon.

    Nicéphore Niépce made it first possible to preserve an image taken with a camera obscura in 1826 or 1827 by using a special mixture of bitumen on a glass or metal plate, naming it Heliography. This first preserved image 'View from the Window at Le Gras' is the one you can see in the iPhoto icon.
