    As part of Ocean Protocol v3, I was leading the planning and execution of the Ocean Market product and decentralized web app in 2020. Ocean Market allows simple tokenization, secure sharing, and monetization of data assets within the Ethereum network with the help of data tokens.

    Assets can be exposed to dynamic price discovery by attaching Automated Market Maker (AMM) pools to them. Metadata is stored on-chain, and all actions like downloading or Compute-to-Data are done via exchanging data tokens, creating trustless provenance records in the process.

    The market project is open-source and has been forked and used to create further data marketplaces on top of Ocean Protocol.

  slug: oceanprotocol-ipfs
  description: |
    In 2019 I was leading the integration of IPFS into the Ocean Protocol stack, from the core to the libraries, up to the UI in multiple touchpoints. 

    For making IPFS as decentralized file storage solution as seemless as possible to use within Ocean Protocol, a public IPFS node was created with a simple user-facing UI and API. The integration was completed by allowing users to add their files to IPFS directly in the [Commons](/oceanprotocol-commons/) publish flow.

  description: |
    From 2018–⁠2019 I was leading the design and development of the Commons marketplace, a Web3 data marketplace to explore, download, and publish open data sets registered in the [Ocean Protocol](/oceanprotocol) network.

    As the main front-facing UI of Ocean Protocol v1 & v2, it served as a product and showcase bringing together the complete Ocean Protocol stack in a simple interface. Additionally, the project was created with developers in mind, making Commons the most complete boilerplate for creating dApps on top of Ocean Protocol.

    With the release of Ocean Protocol v3, Commons has been superseded by [Ocean Market](/oceanprotocol-market/).

    Since 2017 I'm leading the UI design & development of Ocean Protocol, iterating on a components-based UI design system spanning all of Ocean Protocol's web properties. Additionally, I conceptualize, execute and iterate on the creative and visual direction of the Ocean Protocol brand.

    Most web interfaces are single-page JavaScript applications built with React, pulling their data from multiple sources. All design & development is embedded in continuous deployment processes via GitHub, Travis, Kubernetes, and Vercel.

    In 2020 I was leading the refresh of Ocean Protocol's visual identity for the release of v3 and the [Ocean Market](/oceanprotocol-market/).

    With ascribe, users were able to tokenize digital art and real life assets onto the Bitcoin blockchain. It was one of the very first decentralized apps using a decentralized ledger as its backend, all before Ethereum even existed. The principles around digital art as entries in a blockchain, given out in editions, would later inspire the ERC-721 NFT standard on the Ethereum blockchain. Finally, the learnings around a decentralized approach for storing structured data led to the creation of [BigchainDB](/bigchaindb).

    From 2015-2017 I worked on the UI development for multiple web touch points, including the main web app built with one of the first versions of React. The service and web app was [discontinued in 2017](https://www.ascribe.io/).

    Besides designing and implementing new features, I maintained the front-end of the ChartMogul application and implemented the UI design system by refactoring most of its front-end codebase.

    I was leading the UI design & development of all ezeep touch points and - as a product designer - defined the ezeep product based on user and market research in an iterative process. On top of that, I designed and helped building all app experiences of ezeep on Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.

    Nicéphore Niépce made it first possible to preserve an image taken with a camera obscura in 1826 or 1827 by using a special mixture of bitumen on a glass or metal plate, naming it Heliography. This first preserved image 'View from the Window at Le Gras' is the one you can see in the iPhoto icon.
