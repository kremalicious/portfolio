  description: |
    Vado is a decentralized URL shortener, built on the Base network. It enables users to create, manage, and resolve short links that are stored onchain.

    I helped brand, design and build the service from the ground up in 2025, from smart contracts to the resolver architecture to the Astro-based frontend. I focused on balancing usability with robustness, ensuring links can be accessed through various grades of decentralization.

    Token-gating and fee mechanics are enforced at the smart contract level. The frontend reflects this by offering a gated dashboard and analytics view for token holders. Both the app and documentation are built with a minimal stack using Astro, but otherwise framework-less, to maximize robustness, longevity, and ease of maintenance.

  description: |
    As part of Ocean Protocol v3, I was leading the planning and execution of the Ocean Market product and decentralized web app in 2020.

    Ocean Market allows for seamless tokenization, sharing, and monetization of valuable data assets within EVM-compatible networks through the use of data tokens.

    Assets can be exposed to dynamic price discovery by attaching Automated Market Maker (AMM) pools to them. All metadata is securely stored on the blockchain, and every action - from downloading to Compute-to-Data - is done through exchanging data tokens, establishing a trustless chain of provenance records.

    Not only is Ocean Market open-source, but it has also inspired the creation of other data marketplaces built on top of Ocean Protocol.

  slug: oceanprotocol-ipfs
  description: |
    In 2019 I took on the challenge of seamlessly integrating IPFS into the Ocean Protocol stack, from the core all the way up to multiple touchpoints in the UI.

    For making IPFS as decentralized file storage solution as seemless as possible to use within Ocean Protocol, a public IPFS node was created with a simple user-facing UI and API. This was followed by allowing users to effortlessly add their files to IPFS directly through the convenient publish flow in [Commons](/oceanprotocol-commons/).

    From 2018 to 2019, I was leading the design and development of the Commons marketplace - a groundbreaking decentralized platform for exploring, downloading, and publishing open data sets on the [Ocean Protocol](/oceanprotocol) network.

    Serving as the main face of Ocean Protocol v1 & v2, the Commons marketplace not only provided a simple interface for showcasing the full Ocean Protocol stack, but also acted as a valuable resource for developers. It was designed with the developer community in mind, making it the most comprehensive boilerplate for building dApps on top of Ocean Protocol.

    With the advent of Ocean Protocol v3, the Commons marketplace has been succeeded by [Ocean Market](/oceanprotocol-market/).

    Between 2017 and 2020, I led the UI design and development of Ocean Protocol, constantly refining its components-based UI design system across all of its web properties. In addition to that, I conceptualized, executed and iterated on the creative and visual direction of the Ocean Protocol brand.

    The web interfaces were mostly single-page JavaScript applications built with React, with data pulled from multiple sources for seamless user experiences. Design and development was integrated into a continuous deployment process.

    In 2020, I spearheaded the refresh of Ocean Protocol's visual identity in advance of the v3 release and the launch of [Ocean Market](/oceanprotocol-market/).

These principles inspired the ERC-721 NFT standard on the Ethereum blockchain and later led to the creation of [BigchainDB](/bigchaindb).

    The main website, including landing pages, was built as a static site using Jekyll and a custom Gulp-based build pipeline. Meanwhile, the blog was powered by WordPress with a custom theme.

    In addition to designing and implementing new features, I also maintained the front-end of the ChartMogul application and refactored most of its front-end codebase.

    Michelle Myung was responsible for directing the branding, design, and key visuals of ChartMogul.
