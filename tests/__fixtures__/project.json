Ocean Market allows simple tokenization, secure sharing, and monetization of data assets within the Ethereum network with the help of data tokens.\nAssets can be exposed to dynamic price discovery by attaching Automated Market Maker (AMM) pools to them. Metadata is stored on-chain, and all actions like downloading or Compute-to-Data are done via exchanging data tokens, creating trustless provenance records in the process.\nThe market project is open-source and has been forked and used to create further data marketplaces on top of Ocean Protocol.",
